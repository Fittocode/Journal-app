You know what the problem is with Twitter? There's no privacy! Well...duh. It's a social media app. But even so, don't you just wish you had something that looked like Twittewr and worked like Twitter, but for an audience of one: yourself? A platform where you could express yourself in juicy bite-sized little individual nuggets of thoughts, laid out in a satisfying, top-down linear fashion organized by topic for easy access? I sure did! 

That's why I decided to build an application very much reminiscient of Twitter, but also very much NOT twitter. No endless threads from people you don't even follow, no political mud-slinging, no ADHD-inducing information overload. In essence, freedom. A freedom to express your thoughts, however personal, in a sacred place, like that of a church or synagogue——just one that reflects the latest trends in UI.

Try it out!
